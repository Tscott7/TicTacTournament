Cinnamon Fresh Tic-Tac-Tournament is a fun and enjoyable implementation of the relatively unknown and uncommon game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. While there may be a learning curve for a new user, we hope that they can still have fun while trashtalking their opponent on our built-in char client. 

This game is meant to be hosted on a service such as Amazon's AWS and is accessible via a web browser on nearly any type of device, and nearly any browser. This is because the underlying technology we use is inherantly cross-platform and we have implemented queries to make sure our software fits on mobile screens. This technology includes Javascript, HTML, SocketIO, FLASK, Python, and Mongo DB. For details regarding installation, please refer to InstallationGuide.docx. Additional details for administrators who plan on hosting this software can be found in AdminstatorGuide.docx. 

Once users have navigated to the appropriate website on the device of their choosing, they will have the chance to enter a their name or alias. This allows them to communicate (with their chosen identity) on the global message board before they create a lobby for a game. Once a lobby is created, two players can join it directly from the main landing page with the global chat. After that, Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe commences. Rules and strategies exist freely on the internet. Additional information about rules and user experiences can be found in UserGuide.docx. 

We wish you luck in setting up the server side using your preferred hosting solution, and invite you to contact us at TTTSupport@gmail.com if problems arise.

Have fun and remember to observe your opponent carefully to devlop a counterstrategy.
